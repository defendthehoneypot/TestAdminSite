## When Do I Need This?

You need to register your IP address when:

- ✅ **First time** accessing VPN from a new location
- ✅ **Working from home** for the first time
- ✅ **Traveling** and need to work remotely
- ✅ **Changed locations** (moved, new office, etc.)
- ✅ **Using a coffee shop, hotel, or public space**

You do **NOT** need to register:

- ❌ Every time you connect to VPN (only once per location)
- ❌ When using a permanent location you've already registered
- ❌ When already in the office on the corporate network

## What Information is Collected?

Vesper Secure only collects minimal information:

- Your corporate email/identity
- Your current IP address
- Location type (permanent or temporary)

Your organization's administrator can see your registered locations.
