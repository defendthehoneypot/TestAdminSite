## Frequently Asked Questions

### How often do I need to do this?

You only need to register each location once:

- **Permanent locations** (like your home): Register once, works indefinitely
- **Temporary locations** (like a coffee shop): Register each time, expires after configured duration (usually 24 hours)

### What if I'm traveling?

Register each new location as temporary before trying to connect to VPN. This gives you immediate access for that trip.

### Can I register multiple locations?

Yes! You can have multiple permanent locations (home, office, etc.) and register temporary locations as needed.

### What if I forget to register before traveling?

No problem - just visit [access.vespersecure.com](https://access.vespersecure.com){:target="_blank"} from your new location and register it. Wait 5 minutes, then your VPN will work.

### Does this work on mobile devices?

Yes! Open the access portal on your phone or tablet browser and complete the same steps.

### What information does Vesper see?

Vesper only sees:
- Your corporate email/identity
- Your IP address
- Whether the location is permanent or temporary
- When you registered

Your organization's admin can see your registered locations.

### Will this slow down my connection?

No - Vesper only controls whether you can connect. Once connected, your VPN performance is the same as before.
